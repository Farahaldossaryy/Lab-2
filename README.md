## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and fare. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and is used for a machine learning task.

## Machine Learning Problem
This project addresses a supervised classification problem. The target variable is "Survived", which indicates whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## Objective
The objective is to predict passenger survival based on available features using machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
The workflow includes dataset selection, data loading, preprocessing, train-test splitting, model training, evaluation, and result analysis.
