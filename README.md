## Mall Customers Segmentation – Machine Learning Lab 2

This project uses the Mall Customers dataset obtained from Kaggle to perform customer segmentation using machine learning techniques.

The task is an unsupervised learning problem (clustering), where customers are grouped based on features such as age, annual income, and spending score. There is no target variable in this dataset.

A Jupyter Notebook was created to load and inspect the dataset using Python and Pandas. In addition, a methodology diagram was designed to illustrate the overall machine learning workflow from data selection to clustering results.
